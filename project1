#IAAC | Automate infrastructure 
#Define infrastructure state
#ansible, puppet or chef automates mostly OS related tasks
----> Define machines state. But it can't maintain itself

#On on the other hand , Terraform automates infra itself and 
#also maintain its state like any aws, gcp , azure digital ocean etc

#Terraform works with automation softwares like ansible after infra is setup
and ready. Now Terraform combining together with automation 
tools like ansible can give you complete automation.
-->Once you infrastructure is set up , if you are provisioning 
---> ec2 instances launching with Terraform, you like to provision it with some software packages. You can use Ansible ,
puppet or Terraform with that , Other wise normal bash Script is fine.

---> it has No prpgraming language , its own sysntax similar to JSON
It's just matter of learning the syntax of Terraform
---Once you know the Terraform syntax and the basic execution, then you can use the Terraform documentation and write your complete automation or infrastructure state.

---Terraform does not have any programing language.
---It has its own systax domain specific language, DSL
---which is similar to JSON, very easy to understand.
---On top of that it has great documentation
---Rememever in DevOps we need to automate evrything we know how to automate systems.

---Infrastructure automation centralized
